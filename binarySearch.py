# Binary Search
# You are given an array of distinct integers nums, sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.

# Implement a function to search for target within nums. If it exists, then return its index, otherwise, return -1.

# Your solution must run in 
# O
# (
# l
# o
# g
# n
# )
# O(logn) time.

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [-1,0,2,4,6,8], target = 4

# Output: 3
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [-1,0,2,4,6,8], target = 3

# Output: -1
# Constraints:

# 1 <= nums.length <= 10000.
# -10000 < nums[i], target < 10000
